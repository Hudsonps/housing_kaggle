# Pipeline for ML Model Development

## Build virtual environment

First, check if you have the conda package manager by invoking `conda` in the command line. If it is not installed, download the version of miniconda appropriate for your operating system [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Once installed, `cd` in the repository and build the virtual environment using the dependencies listed in `environment.yaml` by running

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
